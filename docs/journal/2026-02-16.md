## Course Correction: Repository Confusion

**What happened:**
- Late night work session led to pulling down the wrong repository
- Cloned `TheEveLife` (zerocool0133700-lgtm/TheEveLife) instead of `EveLife` (zerocool0133700-lgtm/EveLife)
- `TheEveLife` is an older C# project (core library + Windows Forms UI) — will deal with later
- `EveLife` is the correct, newly created repo (Feb 16, 2026) for the current project

**Current state:**
- ✅ Correct `EveLife` repo now cloned at `~/EveLife` (currently empty, ready for new content)
- `~/TheEveLife` exists but is separate — to be addressed later
- Knowledge base system (`/docs`) successfully created in `ellie-dev` repository

## Knowledge Base System Launch

**Decision:** Hybrid approach using Git + Markdown as source of truth

**Structure created:**
```
/home/ellie/ellie-dev/docs/
├── architecture/     # System design, technical decisions
├── projects/         # Project-specific documentation
├── reference/        # How-to guides, runbooks, references
├── journal/          # Daily logs, decision records
└── ideas/           # Brainstorming, future possibilities
```

**Purpose:**
1. Knowledge dumps to stay synchronized with Claude
2. Double-check work with documented history
3. Track what's going on across projects and conversations

**Next steps:**
- Seed content before implementing Elasticsearch indexing (step 3)
- Optional Obsidian GUI integration later (step 4)

## Active Projects
